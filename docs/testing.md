# Testing the Teacher App

| Command | What it runs | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `npm test` | 92 unit tests (Vitest): pure logic, security helpers, translations, colour contrast | nothing |
| `npm run test:integration` | 41 integration tests against a real Postgres, calling the real server actions | `TEST_DATABASE_URL` |
| `npm run test:watch` | unit tests, re-run on save | nothing |

## Integration tests use a throwaway database
They `TRUNCATE` every table. The three apps share one real database, so the helper in
`test/db.ts` **refuses to run unless the database name ends in `_test`** (verified: it refuses `courses_student`).

```bash
createdb courses_test
# Only the Student Diary has migrations; Teacher and Admin can use `npx prisma db push` instead:
URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/courses_test
# Set both: the migration config prefers DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED if your .env defines it.
DATABASE_URL=$URL DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=$URL npx prisma migrate deploy
TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/courses_test npm run test:integration
```

CI does the same on a Postgres service container (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## What is covered
- **Sessions and passwords:** signing, expiry, tampering, `alg: none`, wrong secret, weak secret, bcrypt, token hashing.
- **Login rate limit** (real database): 5 failures per email, 100 per IP, 15-minute window, resets separate from logins.
- **Dates:** Asia/Baku days, DST, week and month arithmetic.
- **Marks and grading:** weighted average, bands, attendance rate and levels, the unique mark per homework.
- **Translations:** az, en and ru have identical keys, no empty strings, identical `{placeholders}`.
- **Colour contrast:** every text, button and focus colour meets WCAG AA in light and dark (reads the real CSS).
- **Grading transaction:** grade, re-grade (same mark, history row), same score twice (no duplicate notification), outdated attempt, returned work, left students, `giveZero` (before deadline, double tap, late hand-in replaces it).
- **Authorization:** a teacher cannot read or change another teacher's group, lesson, mark or submission; a substitute may take attendance but not give marks; **every exported action rejects a request that is not a signed-in teacher** (a new action without a guard fails the test).
- **Locked term:** every write is refused.
- **Gradebook CSV:** 401 without a session, 404 for another teacher's group, UTF-8 BOM, formula injection neutralised.
